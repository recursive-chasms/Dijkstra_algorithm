Note: Actual route from 1 to 6:

1 -> 4 -> 7 -> 6

Supposed route: 
7 -> 6 
3 -> 5 
4 -> 5 
2 -> 4 
1 -> 2 

The nodes of the actual route exist in the output. Need to find a means of eliminating the redundant ones. Probably won't be very efficient. Will probably help to refactor the linked lists into arrays.
