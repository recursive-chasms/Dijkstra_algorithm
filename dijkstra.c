/*
This is my most current implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

It is essentially a bare-bones navigation program which
finds the shortest distances between the starting point
and the rest of the points on the map. It also finds the
specific shortest path from the starting point to the
destination point. 

In computer science terms:

-- "graph" means "map" (...within this context. In
reality, a graph data structure can represent many kind 
of relationships--not just physical distances.)
-- "node" means "point/location on the map"

I originally wrote a C++ version for one of the later
assignments in my Data Structures class in Fall of 2017.
It wasn't that great. So in preparation for an interview
earlier this year, I started rewriting it from scratch. 

This version came out much better than the 2017 version.
Since finding the shortest path within a graph is a
fundamental computing task, I saw fit to include it in my
public portfolio. 

More detailed documentation may be found within the inline
comments, especially starting at line 147.
