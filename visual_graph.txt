Visual representation of the graph associated with input.txt,
with source nodes on the y axis and destination nodes on the x 
axis. The weights/distances are shone in the body of the graph.

Thus, the distance from 1 to 2 is 2, while the distance from 1 
to 4 is just 1. It is a massive hike from 2 to 5. And, somehow, 
you can't get from 5 back to 2. There's no going back. (I.e., 
it's a directed graph.)
